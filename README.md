# CS300

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
ABCU needed a program to sort, list and view course schedules from a CSV text file. Each line included a course ID and course name, and some courses included prerequisites.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I broke it down into discrete parts and functions. A function to read the data and output the proper data structure. A function to sort the data. A function to print the data. Another function to print the data a different way. Consideration of the data structure for storing the data was important for optimial runtime speed during program execution. I chose my implementation based on what the client said was important for the program, as well as what I considered were more or less common use cases for the data in question.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I used the time-honored developer tradition of Stack Overflow and asking other developers for help. Plus using critical thinking, problem solving skills and logically pondering the various aspects of the program and how they would be adapted to code.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
It gave me additional experience writing pseudocode and considering various data types using objective runtime measures.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I didn't really learn anything about how to IMPLEMENT programs. But see above for expanding my approach to designing software.
